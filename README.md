# Code based off Code for the Recurrent Neural Network in the presentation "Tensorflow and deep learning - without a PhD, Part 2"

## Usage:

```
> python rnn_train.py
```
To check on progress:

``` 
**The original Github noted to use python 3 but my computer glitched with the command python3 becuase I uninstalled python 2**
```
> python3 -m unittest tests.py
```
Unit tests can be run with the command above.
