I am starting to think that there is something seriously wrong with President Obama's mental health. Why won't he stop the flights. Psycho!
With all of the words President Obama just dispensed at his press conference he didn't say what we all want to hear"I'LL STOP THE FLIGHTS"
President Obama has a personal responsibility to visit &amp; embrace all people in the US who contract Ebola!
Obama still refuses to stop the flights. Is he stubborn or just plain incompetent - I say both!
Michelle Nunn will be a solid vote for  Obama. She supports ObamaCare &amp; opposes 2nd Amendment. Vote for  @Perduesenate to change things!

The military generals are fuming at Obama. He has boxed them in against ISIS with a strategy that is destined to fail. Sad!
I don't know if President Obama isn't stopping the flights from Ebola torn West Africa because he is stubborn stupid or just doesn't care!
President Obama NOW bring our 4000 innocent and ill-trained soldiers home from West Africa before it is too late AND STOP THE FLIGHTS!
If a conservative Republican made the mistake that Mrs. Obama just made by calling Braley by the wrong name it would be the biggest story!

Obama lied when he said “you can keep your plan” so why would anyone believe his bogus ObamaCare enrollment numbers?!
"@Bigonbeets: @realDonaldTrump If you could do anything to change the world for the better what would you do?"  Fire Obama!
"@TristacksEff: @realDonaldTrump would bring us back from this mess @BarackObama put us in. #RunForPresident #2016"  True!
"@BradANGSA: @sonnset2 @ForQ2 @realDonaldTrump  @GreaseWeezer Obama would not have won election if he told truth about Obama-Care.."
"If Trump became president he would do an amazing job; if Obama took over Celebrity Apprentice he'd fail."  What's your opinion? I agree!
Because of President Obama's failed leadership we have put Vladimir Putin &amp; Russia back on the world stage! --No reason for this.
"@Winger23: Obamacare has ruined healthcare. Everyone I know is having a hard time paying their new plans. It costs too much!"
By Obama mentioning Manhattan yesterday in his response he has singlehandedly made it target #1. How totally stupid is this guy?
Not good or smart for Obama to be calling Russia a "regional" power or to mention the concept of a nuclear weapon going off in NYC.
President Obama looks absolutely exhausted in the Netherlands. He is not a natural leader was never ment to lead - it is tough work for him
Obama should stop running down the stairs when getting off Air Force One.  Doesn’t look presidential and at some point he will take a fall.
Obama must now FOCUS get his mind off "March.Madness" and LEAD! Watch Russia closely work hard on the economy and get rid of ObamaCare!
I believe Putin will continue to re-build the Russian Empire. He has zero respect for Obama or the U.S.!
Putin has become a big hero in Russia with an all time high popularity. Obama on the other hand has fallen to his lowest ever numbers. SAD
President Obama be cool be smart be sharp and FOCUS (no more March Madness) and you can beat Putin at his own game. IT CAN BE DONE!
While Putin is scheming and beaming on how to take over the World President Obama is watching March Madness (basketball)!
I don't hate Obama at all I just think he is an absolutely terrible president maybe the worst in our history!
President Obama was able to fool the Americans by getting elected but not able to fool Vladimir Putin. Too bad for us!
President Obama could totally solve the problem with Putin by demanding that Russia sign on to ObamaCare thereby destroying their economy!
Wow Putin is really taking advantage of President Obama. It is important that Obama responds with strength and determination-be smart-cool!
"@sdillam: @realDonaldTrump shuts down NBC’s @MLauer: ‘Putin has eaten Obama’s lunch’ http://t.co/nOaLA2O61k He's a spineless coward.
"@StandAtTheReady: Putin has eaten Obama's lunch therefore our lunch for a long period of time. - @realDonaldTrump VERY TRUE!!! #TeaParty"
AMAZING how the press protected President Obama when he did the so-called comedy routine with Zach G. He looked like a fool - they said cute
"@sendit40 tried yr mobile app to check out yr hotel rates in Doral. App works effortlessly is easy to use to book rooms" Unlike ObamaCare
Actually I was very nice to Jimmy Carter during my standing room only (&amp; standing ovation) speech for CPAC - stated better Pres. than Obama!
What do you think Obama will do when Putin seizes Alaska?
.@Mitt Romney strongly stated in one of the debates with Pres. OBAMA that Russia is the big problem. Obama scoffed. Mitt was 100% correct!
Was President Obama in charge of this years Academy Awards - they remind me of the ObamaCare website!  #Oscars.
Obama just stated "he didn't take school seriously made bad choices and GOT HIGH" - then how the hell did he get into Columbia &amp; Harvard?
We could make America great again by spreading ObamaCare throughout the World while at the same time  dropping it from U.S.!
Whether you like it or not the Russians did a great job in hosting the Olympics! Remember when Obama went to Europe to get Olympics-fourth.
Russia beat the United States in the Olympics-another Obama embarrassment! Isn't it time that we turn things around and start kicking ass?
"@mfantauzzo1: please save this country Mr. Trump going to take a business genius to clean up Obamas mistakes. You got my vote!"
If ObamaCare is such a wonderful law then why does Obama summarily  change the law before an election?
Wow just in - ObamaCare projected to cause large scale drop in jobs - even Dems are shocked by 2.5 million number. DISASTER!
CBO estimates over 2.3M jobs will be lost due to ObamaCare http://t.co/CHG5fhA2Q5 Elections have consequences.
Congrats to Pres.Obama and Dems. CBO has TRIPLED its estimate of working hours lost due to ObamaCare http://t.co/CHG5fhA2Q5 Job Killer
"@Gfeorg: @realDonaldTrump President Obama should visit Macy's and buy some beautiful Trump silk ties."
Obama said in his SOTU that “global warming is a fact.” Sure about as factual as “if you like your healthcare you can keep it.”
Once ObamaCare is fully enacted in NY conveniently after 2014 expect higher premiums bigger deductibles &amp; worse care. Job killer!
Welcome to the new reality! Moody’s just downgraded the entire US health insurance industry because of ObamaCare.
I will be on the Mike &amp; Mike Show on radio and ESPN-at about 6 to 7 A.M. We will be talking Super Bowl and sports-no Obama Care!
The Senate should immediately vote on the Iranian sanctions bill. What is the delay? Iran is already breaking its agreement with Obama
Watching Gates on @seanhannity - looks like he got hit by a truck! Why didn't Obama get him and othersto sign a confidentiality agreement?
"@Sunflowers362: @realDonaldTrump I have been reviewing my options for this #Obamacare it has me with #sleepless #nights. I'm worried!"
Whether you like Obama or not Bob Gates turned out to be one disloyal dude! Personally I hate rats.
"@Jenylyn23: @realDonaldTrump what would be your first action as President?"  TO END OBAMACARE!
Now that the ObamaCare website contractor has been terminated for obvious incompetence is the person who hired them going to be fired?
President Obama just fired the ObamaCare website builder. My question is why were they hired in the first place? Sue them for damages!
"@JasonGandy: @realDonaldTrump Donald why the hell don't you run for President. Business genius unlike @BarackObama. #2016"
Why didn’t Gates resign if he was so unhappy about what he was being told by Obama? The fact is Iraq etc. have always been disasters!
While I am a critic of President Obama I hate it when someone (Robert Gates) writes a self serving negative book about his boss.
Welcome to the new ObamaCare reality – Doctor spent 2 hours on hold w/insurance company to get approval for surgery http://t.co/W2Lru0takZ
It's Jan. 2. President Obama should end his vacation early &amp; get back to Washington to straighten out the ObamaCare catastrophe--or end it.
Secret Service members on break from Obama’s $4M vacation are more than welcomed to relax at Hawaii’s top hotel @TrumpWaikiki.
Guess what folks--the ObamaCare website just went down again. What a disaster.
It’s Friday. How many people have been forced off their plans and lost their doctors today because of ObamaCare?
White House relaxes penalty for canceled health policies a major blow  to the sustainability (and concept) of ObamaCare! They are desperate
ObamaCare Horror Story: “Navigators Tell Applicants To Lie Like Administration” http://t.co/o3cUA4gYzR @JamesOKeefeIII strikes again!
Can’t fool Americans. 57% of uninsured hate ObamaCare http://t.co/U1Du47apAs Reality is less will be insured b/c of this monstrosity.
Every day Pastor Saeed is imprisoned by Iran is an indictment on Obama’s ‘diplomacy.’ #SaveSaeed
Pres. Obama is about to embark on a 17 day vacation in his ‘native’ Hawaii putting Secret Service away from families on Christmas. Aloha!
No cuts to welfare no cuts to food stamps &amp; NOT A SINGLE CUT TO OBAMACARE yet the new budget cuts military benefits. Sad!
"@moonorion: You very honorably tried to help #freepastorsaeed when Obama abandoned another Christian. Stand up against #AETV w us now!"
Alternatives are important but first Repubs must repeal ObamaCare. It's an unsustainable monstrosity that's destroying our healthcare.
Benghazi is now a full blown training center for jihadists http://t.co/2511unQf1I Congratulations to the Obama administration.
